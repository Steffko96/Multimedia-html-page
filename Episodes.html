					<h2>Ratings:</h2>
					<p>
						With its first season, The Simpsons became the Fox network's first series to rank among the top thirty highest-rated shows of a television season. Due to this success, Fox decided to switch The Simpsons' timeslot in hopes of higher ratings for the shows airing after it. The series moved from 8:00 p.m. eastern time on Sundays to the same time on Thursdays, where it competed with The Cosby Show, the number-one show at the time.

						Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons had been in the top ten while airing on Sunday, and they felt the move would destroy its ratings. Ratings-wise, new episodes of The Cosby Show beat The Simpsons every time during the second season, and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top ten. At the end of the season, Cosby averaged as the fifth-highest-rated show on television, while The Simpsons was thirty-eighth.

						The show continued in its Thursday timeslot until the sixth season, which is when, in 1994, it reverted to its original slot on Sunday. It has remained there ever since.
